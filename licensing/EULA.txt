RESEARCH EXEMPTION INVALIDATION
This section controls over any conflicting language elsewhere in the Terms.
A. No Research, Academic, or Experimental Exception
No research, academic, scientific, or experimental use—whether commercial or non-commercial—creates an exception to these Terms.
For avoidance of doubt:
* “Research use”
* “Academic research”
* “University projects”
* “Institutional research”
* “Grant-funded research”
* “Internal evaluation”
* “Security research”
* “Safety research”
* “Benchmarking”
* “Exploratory experimentation”
* “Non-commercial research”
* “Fair use research”

DO NOT grant permission to violate any restriction in these Terms.
If a use is prohibited, it remains prohibited regardless of purpose, intent, affiliation, or funding source.
B. No Institutional or Multi-Person Research Use
Use of the Software is strictly limited to a single natural person.
You may not use the Software:
   * As part of a university, lab, or institutional research effort,
   * On shared academic compute, clusters, or labs,
   * As part of coursework, capstones, or theses,
   * By multiple researchers, students, or collaborators,
   * Under IRB, ethics board, or grant approval.

“Internal research” involving more than one person is prohibited.
C. No Publication, Disclosure, or Presentation of Results
You may not:
      * Publish outputs, benchmarks, evaluations, or findings,
      * Present results in papers, preprints, talks, posters, or workshops,
      * Submit results to journals, conferences, or archives (including arXiv),
      * Share outputs in repositories, datasets, or supplementary materials,
      * Disclose findings publicly or privately to third parties.

This includes negative results, safety analyses, and methodological descriptions.
Private personal notes are permitted.
Anything shared outside your own possession is not.
D. No Research “Tooling” Argument
You may not claim that the Software is:
         * Merely a “tool” used incidentally,
         * “Not central” to the research,
         * “Only for evaluation,”
         * “Only used to generate examples,”
         * “Used for comparison or baselining.”

Any use of the Software within a research workflow triggers full applicability of these Terms.
E. No Derivative Claims Based on Research Status
You may not argue that restrictions are inapplicable because:
            * Outputs are not redistributed,
            * The Software is not monetized,
            * The work is educational,
            * The work is publicly beneficial,
            * The research is safety-motivated,
            * The work is open access.
F. No Fair Use, Interoperability, or Reverse Engineering Defense
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
            * Fair use does not grant permission to violate these Terms.
            * Interoperability exceptions do not permit hosting, exposure, or redistribution.
            * Reverse engineering beyond private inspection is prohibited.
            * Model extraction, behavioral cloning, or systematic probing is prohibited.
G. Explicit Prohibition on Safety & Red-Team Research
Unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company:
You may not use the Software for:
            * Red-teaming,
            * Adversarial testing,
            * Jailbreak discovery,
            * Safety evaluation,
            * Alignment or governance research,
            * Comparative safety benchmarking.

Unauthorized safety research is treated as misuse.
H. No “Permission by Silence”
Lack of enforcement, lack of response, or public availability of the Software:
               * Does not imply consent,
               * Does not grant a license,
               * Does not create an implied research exception,
               * Does not waive any restriction.

Permission must be explicit, written, and signed by the Company.
I. Burden of Proof
You bear the sole burden of demonstrating that your use:
                  * Falls within permitted private use,
                  * Involves no third-party access,
                  * Involves no institutional affiliation,
                  * Involves no publication or disclosure,
Involves no hosting or exposure.

Any ambiguity is resolved against permissibility.
J. Enforcement Presumption
If the Company reasonably believes that use:
                     * Is affiliated with research,
                     * Is institutional in nature,
                     * Is intended for publication,
                     * Involves multiple people,
                     * Is positioned as “evaluation” or “analysis”,

The Company may immediately terminate the license without further investigation.
K. Survival
All restrictions in this section survive termination and apply retroactively to any prior use.
